# QTM350 Final Project - Keerthy Rangan, Ria Krishna, and Rishi Khullar
Our final project focuses on comparing education levels and outcomes across different regions in Asia. Specifically, we are looking at the top 3 most populous countries from South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia.

Our repository includes a data folder with the raw initial data we used and the cleaned data we created by using SQL. We have a figures folder containing all of the graphs and plots created with Python as well as a codebook explaining each of the variables we used. 

To run our code navigate to the scripts folder to access the SQL and jupyter notebooks we used.

To access the Python Data Cleaning files and Python Data Analysis files, you can use VS Code. For the SQL file, you can use VSCode or PostgreSQL.
